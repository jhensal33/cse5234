<h2>Everybody loves our feline friends. They're soft, warm, and friendly. Because of all these incredible characteristics, some individuals have accrued a few too many cats. That's why we've put policies in place to limit cats per customer. Our customers are now permitted to only own: 13 cats, 1 tiger, 2 cheetahs, 2 panthers, and 4 lynxes. Customers who own more than the proclaimed amount will have their cats reclaimed by Feline Beeline LLC.</h2>
